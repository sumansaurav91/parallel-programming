## What is parallel computing?

* Doing things simultaneously
  - Same thing or different things
  - Solving one large problem
* Serial Computing
  - Problem is broken into stream of instructions that executed one after the other on a single processor.
  - One instruction executes at a time.
* Parallel Computing
  - Problem is broken into parts that can be solved concurrently
  - Each part is further broken into a stream of instructions
  - Instructions from different parts execute simultaneously on different processors

## Why Parallel Computing?

* The real world is parallel
  - Complex, inter-related events happen simultaneously
    - E.g, galaxies, planetary movements, functioning of the brain, weather traffic
  - Paralle computing is better suited for modeling, simulation of these processes
* Why use parallel Computing
  - Save time, produce results in resonable time for them to be useful
    - weather modeling, automated stock trading
  - Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers don't fit on a PC - thet have huge memory requirements
* Processors are not getting any faster
  - Heat dissipation/Power consumption issues
 
## Where is parallel computing used?

* Scientific Computing - Numerically intensive simulation
* Database operations
* AL, ML and Deep Learning
* Real time systems and control applications - Robotics, Speech processing, pattern recognition
